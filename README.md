Milk Quality Prediction (Classification)

About dataset
This dataset: is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the quality of milk.
This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.

The target variable is nothing but the Grade of the milk. It can be: Low (Bad), Medium (Moderate), High (Good).

If Taste, Odor, Fat, and Turbidity are satisfied with optimal conditions then they will assign 1 otherwise 0.
Temperature and ph are given their actual values in the dataset.

We have to perform data preprocessing, and data augmentation techniques to build statistical and predictive models to predict the quality of the milk.

Inspiration: To leverage the benefits of machine learning in the dairy industry.

Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

Best worked: Random Forest.
